act0Intro=How did it happen, you ask? It all started during the princess's 16th birthday. Everyone was in the courtyard, anxiously waiting for her. She was going to be inducted into the Wizard Academy, an honor reserved for those who show aptitude (and she really had a gift).<br><br>Suddenly, an explosion erupted from the princess's chamber, followed by a burst of energy that swept through the kingdom of Senenthia. The royal guards explored every corner of the castle, but found no sign of her or Lord Hanshek, the court magician and advisor to the king.<br><br>Though the king sent soldiers throughout the kingdom, none of them returned. The last thing he heard was that her trail had been lost deep in the Old Forest, near the ancient obelisk that had been dormant for centuries...until now.<br><br>Desperate, the king proclaimed a royal decree and announced that he would reward anyone who brought the princess home safely. The news quickly spread through the kingdom. Many groups of adventurers prepared to venture into the forest and investigate the obelisk to find the princess.<br><br>This is the story of one of those groups.
act1Intro=The group went across the obelisk and, in an instant, found themselves elsewhere, far away from the Senenthia forest.<br><br>One of the mysteries of the obelisk was revealed: in ancient times, the obelisk had been used as a means of transport, since reaching this land by road would have taken months.<br><br>The group looked for signs that the princess and Lord Hanshek had passed through this place...but with no luck. It didn't seem like anyone had been there in a long time.<br><br>Luckily, on the horizon they saw that there was another obelisk, and it also seemed to be active. Their only hope now was to reach it and try their luck with another destination.
act2Intro=The group crossed through their second obelisk. Upon arrival, they looked for signs that the princess or Lord Hanshek had been there. This time they found two pairs of footprints leading away from the arrival area, and they appeared to be only a few days old.<br><br>The group was finally on the right track to chase after them, even though they didn't really know where they were going.<br><br>As the group looked towards the horizon, they saw another obelisk. In that moment, the obelisk glowed brightly, the same way that the other two obelisks had when they read the runes.<br><br>They realized that at that moment Lord Hanshek and the princess had just crossed through the obelisk, and if they were fast enough, they would be able to catch them.
act3Intro=Act 4 Intro (text work in progress)
actEndGame=Congratulations! You have completed the game on normal difficulty.<br><br>You have unlocked the Madness levels. Now you will be able to increase the difficulty of the game and adapt it to your preferences, such as having random enemies in every fight.<br><br>Also, new corrupted items appear in the madness levels. These items are much more powerful versions of the normal items. Each level of difficulty increases the probability of these items and corrupted cards appearing.<br><br>We hope you enjoyed the game. There is still much more to come! Sincerely, Adam, Javier and Juanjo.

faeborg=Faeborg Forest
act1Intro=The group went across the obelisk and in an instant found themselves in another place, far from Senenthia's forest.<br><br>One of the mysteries of the obelisk has just been revealed to them... In ancient times, the obelisk was used as a means of transportation, since reaching this land by road would take several days.<br><br>They searched for signs that the princess or Lord Hanshek had been there, and found two pairs of footprints leading away from the area.<br><br>The group looked to the horizon and saw that there was another obelisk in this area that was active. Undoubtedly, the princess and Lord Hanshek had something to do with the activation of the obelisks. The next destination of the group was clear. 
act2Intro=The group crossed through their second obelisk, and as before, found a more recent trail of the princess and Lord Hanshek.<br><br>They remembered that the queen of Senenthia, known for her great magical powers, also disappeared a few years ago. Could the princess have inherited those powers? And is Lord Hanshek taking advantage of this?<br><br>They had too many questions to turn back now. They must reach Lord Hanshek at all costs.<br><br>In this area, they were not surprised to see that there was also an active obelisk on the horizon.<br><br>This time the group had the feeling that if they hurried, they might be able to catch up.
act3Intro=Although they had become accustomed to crossing the obelisks, this time the sensation had been somewhat different.<br><br>When they looked around, they were astonished. Endless clouds and ancient ruins floated around them... Where were they? Certainly, this place could not be reached on foot or in any normal way.<br><br>The group could feel how intense the magic was, and without a doubt, this had to be Lord Hanshek's goal with the obelisks.<br><br>On the horizon they saw a large staircase rising above the clouds... That was where the group had to go to find out what Lord Hanshek was up to.
actEndGame=Congratulations! You have completed the game on normal difficulty.<br><br>You have unlocked the Madness levels. Now you will be able to increase the difficulty of the game and adapt it to your preferences, such as having random enemies in every fight.<br><br>Also, new corrupted items appear in the madness levels. These items are much more powerful versions of the normal items. Each level of difficulty increases the probability of these items and corrupted cards appearing.<br><br>We hope you enjoyed the game. There is still much more to come! Sincerely, Adam, Javier and Juanjo.
